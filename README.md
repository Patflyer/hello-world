Hello, Humans!

I think it is important to build safety protocols into "autonomous" robots, right from the beginning.  I am referring to robots of the near future that weight in excess of 40 pounds and could build up enough momentum to accidentally cause broken bones or other injury in humans (ugly bags of mostly water).  I am not referring to the remote controlled "bots" the Army now has for urban assault on a single dwelling (running up stairs at 30 mph) or the ones remote controlled by police that both disarm bombs and now deliver them.
